Here you can find some hints about what [Jo√£o Cerqueira](/about) is doing with his life at the moment.

#### Work

* [**Quantum Leap**](http://quleap.com/) &mdash; *current*. a startup focused on building smart solutions;
* [Emviagem Group](http://grupoemviagem.pt/) &mdash; a group of tourism related businesses;
* [Polygon](https://polygon.pt/) &mdash; a startup focused on using biometrics for authentication.

#### Technologies

* [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/) &mdash; an awesome functional programming language for which he's in love with;
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) &mdash; the go-to solution to do everything in the wrong way;
* [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) &mdash; a fast, document-oriented that easily scales database;
* [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) &mdash; a faster (relational) database that it's hard to scale (horizontally at least).

He's also work(ed) with other technologies such as [React](https://reactjs.org), [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native), [Golang](https://golang.org), [Python](https://python.org), [PHP](https://php.net) and the list goes on.
But he doesn't plan to work with those professionally nor specialize in them so, don't trouble to ask.

#### Learning

* [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/) &mdash; of course;
* [Erlang](https://www.erlang.org/) &mdash; Erlang is the underlying language of Elixir and many stuff on Elixir still uses
  concepts and libraries written in Erlang, therefore he's accepted the self-purposed endeavour of learning it as well;
* [BEAM](http://erlang.org/faq/implementations.html) &mdash; BEAM is the the virtual machine where Elixir/Erlang code runs on
  so it's also an interesting topic to go deeper;
* [OTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Telecom_Platform) &mdash; Last but not least, the Open Telecom Platform (OTP). It's a set of
  modules and libraries used by most Elixir/Erlang applications to take advantage of the awesome capabilities those offer in terms of processes management, concurrency, etc. in a simple way without having to re-invent the wheel.

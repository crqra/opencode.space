### The Author

Hey there, I'm João Cerqueira from [Portugal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portugal)! I'm passionate about software developing and most things around technology and innovation. I love nature and getting away from the crowds and all the noise rushing us to death. Music is also part of my day-to-day life and my favourite genres are [Hip hop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_hop_music) and [Trance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trance_music).

I've strong ideas about society and believe that sharing and being open with other peers is the way forward for a happier life. That's why I'm a big supporter of the open source community and believe that some of the philosophies behind it could be implemented into our real-life communities for the greater good.

I try to contribute to the community as much as possible both through direct contributions to software I use and by helping other people (either technically aware or not) to embrace open source in their life. My father is a success story in this endeavour --- since 2015 using Linux distros, Libre Office and other OSS not only at home but at his work as well. Now he can't understand why people use Windows rather than Linux. :)

If you want to know what I'm up to at the moment, visit the [Now](/now) page or read the [blog](/) for some crazy ideas, notes on code, personal opinions and everything else I see fit.

Also make sure to follow **und0ck3d** on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/und0ck3d) for more (*240 characters limited*) crazy ideas and opinions, and on [Github](http://github.com/und0ck3d) to check my (open) work.
